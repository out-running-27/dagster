# Running multiple agents <Experimental />

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.</Note>

Each Dagster Cloud full deployment (e.g., `prod`) needs to have at least one agent running. Since the agent is lightweight and can tolerate short downtimes such as during an upgrade, a single agent is adequate for most use cases.

If you want to distribute runs across multiple Kubernetes clusters, ECS clusters, EC2 instances, or other environments, you can run multiple agents isolated across these environments. For example, one in each cluster, instance, etc.

It's recommended to only use multiple agents of the same type (e.g. multiple Kubernetes agents). Submitting runs to a specific agent isn't currently supported.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **dagster-cloud version 0.13.0 or later for both agents and job code.**
- **To use a Kubernetes, Docker, or local agent.** These agent types can support running multiple agents.

---

## Step 1: Set up the agent

Follow the setup guide for your agent:

- [Docker](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/docker)
- [Kubernetes](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/kubernetes/configuring-running-kubernetes-agent)
- [Local](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/local)

After the agent is up and running, move on to the next step.

## Step 2: Enable the isolated_agents setting

In this step, you'll enable the `isolated_agents` option to turn on running agents in isolated namespaces. You can also choose to label the agents, making it easily identifiable on Dagster Cloud's **Status** page.

Follow the instructions for your agent:

<details>
  <summary><strong>DOCKER AGENTS</strong></summary>

Add the following to the `dagster.yaml` file:

```yaml
isolated_agents:
  enabled: true

dagster_cloud_api:
  # <your other config>
  agent_label: "My agent" # optional
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>KUBERNETES AGENTS</strong></summary>

Add the following options to your Helm command:

```shell
helm upgrade \
    ...
    --set isolatedAgents.enabled=true \
    --set dagsterCloud.agentLabel="My agent" # optional, only supported on 0.13.14 and later
```

Or if you're using a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
isolatedAgents:
  enabled: true

dagsterCloud:
  agentLabel: "My agent" # optional, only supported on 0.13.14 and later
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>LOCAL AGENTS</strong></summary>

Add the following to the `dagster.yaml` file:

```yaml
isolated_agents:
  enabled: true

dagster_cloud_api:
  # <your other config>
  agent_label: "My agent" # optional
```

</details>
