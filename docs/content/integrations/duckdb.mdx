# DuckDB + Dagster

Using Dagster's [software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) and DuckDB I/O manager, you can easily interact with DuckDB tables alongside other Dagster assets.

Managing your DuckDB tables with Dagster enables you to:

- Use Python to analyze your data stored in DuckDB without writing custom SQL queries to fetch the data
- Visualize the data dependencies between tables
- Selectively update the contents of your tables
- Integrate your DuckDB tables with other tools in your data stack

Additionally, since DuckDB is a local database, you can use the DuckDB I/O manager to test assets that use the Snowflake or BigQuery I/O managers in production scenarios.
